\subsection*{Complexity Analysis}
\subsubsection*{Time Complexity}

The time complexity of the provided backtracking algorithm can be analyzed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The algorithm explores all possible ways to divide the input set into two subsets, considering each element for either subset.
    \item For a set of size $n$, there are $2^n$ possible ways to assign each element to a subset.
\end{itemize}

The recurrence relation for the algorithm is:
\[
T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1
\]
Expanding this recurrence:
\begin{align*}
T(n) &= 2T(n-1) + 1 \\
T(n-1) &= 2T(n-2) + 1 \\
T(n-2) &= 2T(n-3) + 1 \\
&\vdots \\
\end{align*}

Continuing this pattern, we get:
\[
T(n) = 2^n T(0) + 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-2} + \ldots + 2^0
\]

The sum of the geometric series simplifies to:
\[
T(n) = 2^n T(0) + (2^n - 1)
\]

Since $T(0)$ is a constant, we can denote it as $c$. Thus, the time complexity is:
\[
T(n) = O(2^n)
\]

\subsubsection*{Space Complexity}
The space complexity of the algorithm can be analyzed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The algorithm uses a recursive approach, which requires space for the call stack.
    \item The maximum depth of the recursion is $n$, leading to a space complexity of $O(n)$ for the call stack.
    \item Additionally, the algorithm uses space for the subsets and other variables, but these are bounded by $O(n)$ as well.
    \item Therefore, the overall space complexity is $O(n)$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion:} The time complexity of the backtracking algorithm is $O(2^n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$.
